# VENITE - We Unite
### About

We believe that the future is uncertain and any natural disaster can occur any place at any time. So there should exist a website database which keeps a track of trusted volunteers and their achievements so they can be easily identified and summoned during the hour of need.

### Inspiration

Hearing the need for increase in volunteerism, our immediate response was information. If potential volunteers were informed about just what the experience was like, we believe they would be more likely to get involved. Having a network specialized in sharing pictures of volunteering, allows those who might be hesitant to see exactly what to expect and what they're missing out on.

### What it does?
Venite functions as a social network for demonstrating the experience and thrill of volunteering. Bringing a reality to those who have little experience but want more. The badge system and work log format should even promote current volunteers to continue volunteering for increased incentives. 

Our primary concern would be to implement our forum community. Engaging the volunteers or potential volunteers in conversation about past experiences or clarifying any uncertainties is a major goal for our project. 

For security reasons we would be using blockchains because of their properties of immutability and transparency, as a secondary database for continous verification of records.

### Future Prospects
Due to time constraints we were not able to complete these tasks. If given chance we would really like to complete these features -
- We plan to implement automatic volunteer and work matching based upon their forum interactions, interests and previous work by using smart machine learning algorithms.
